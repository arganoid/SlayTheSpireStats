# SlayTheSpireStats
Show wins/runs ratio for each character on a monthly basis

Before running, change STS_PATH on line 5 to match the game's install location.

By default it will only count runs on Ascension 20. This can be disabled by setting ONLY_A20 to False.

Use DAYS_FILTER to filter out runs older than a certain number of days from today's date.
